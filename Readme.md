## 1. Project1: Gazebo-World

### Goal

Design a Gazebo World environment including multiple models and use it as a base for the rest of my projects.

### What I learned
- Launching a Gazebo Environment
- Designing in Gazebo

## 2. Project2: Go Chase It

### Goal

Design and build a mobile robot, and house it in a world. Next, program the robot with nodes and services using C++ in ROS to chase a white colored ball.

### What I learned
- Building Catkin Workspaces
- ROS node creation
- ROS node communication
- Using additional ROS packages
- Gazebo world integration
- RViz integration
- rqt_graph for debugging

## 3. Project3: Where Am I?

### Goal

Interface the mobile robot with the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) algorithm in ROS to estimatethe robot's position as it travels through a predefined set of waypoints, and tune different parameters to increase the localization efficiency of the robot.

### What I learned
- Implementation of Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization in ROS
- How to generate a map using pgm_map_creator
- Using move_base node package
- Understanding of tuning of parameters
